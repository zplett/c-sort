1. Zac Plett and Ezra Goss - This program reads in words input line by line by the user. These words are then sorted based on flags given when running the program.

2. sort.c - This is the main program in the lab, it reads the user input and then calls the appropriate sorter functions based on which method is being used.

   Makefile - Our makefile used to compile the programs.

   sort.h - This is the header file containing function and macro definitions used in sort.c.

   textfile - This contains sample text used for testing output.

3. There are no known bugs and all functions are complete.

4. We guessed that the lab would take us around 10 hours to complete and it did in fact take around 10 hours in total.

5. We affirm that we have adhered to the Honor Code on this assignment.
